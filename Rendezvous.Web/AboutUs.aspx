        <h1>High Performance Building</h1>
        <p>Here at RCH we strive to build a home that is welcoming & comfortable, yet cost effective and environmentally friendly. We reach this goal by incorporating high performance building practices and energy efficient products in to each and every home we build. High Performance Building is the outcome of the design that focuses on increasing the energy efficiency of a home through the use of products and techniques such as air sealing and proper insulation, therefore providing you with a home that is healthy to live in, has a lower ownership cost, added confidence, and provides better performance. Many of the High Performance Products that we use are made from recycled materials that reduce the impact of building on the environment.</p>
            
        <h1>Warranty</h1>
        <p>Every RCH Home is covered by a standard 2-Year in house builder warranty as well as a 10 year structural warranty. We stand behind the homes we build because we care!</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>As a kid Jeff Jeppesen was building anything he could think of, little did he know a business was in the works. From the age fifteen until twenty two, Jeff spent his time laying brick, framing homes, and doing interior millwork. While in his early twenties Jeff had the desire to create homes that would exhibit superb quality and craftsmanship. This is when they took the initiative to follow their dreams. In 2011 they opened the doors to RCH Custom Homes Inc. From its inception, to today, Jeff and John still have the same hands on philosophy, and over the past twenty four years have developed a company known for its creativity in design, superb craftsmanship, and a critical eye for every little detail.</p>
